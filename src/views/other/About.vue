				<h1 class="mtop-lg">About Keyframes</h1>

				<p>
					I had a folder on my bookmarks bar with a bunch of tools I use almost daily. I wasn't quite happy with them though. Some had huge annoying ads, some just didn't work quite right, and some looked like they hadn't been updated since 2004. I wanted to create a single place where all the smaller web-based development tools I use most could live. So that's what Keyframes is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Keyframes gives you a simple UI to adjust and create CSS properties - and see the results & get the output CSS instantly. It's a lot easier than editing more complex CSS - like @Keyframe animations or multi-layered box shadows - in your code editor, where you have to switch back and forth between your browser to see every little change you make.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have to be at least somewhat familiar with CSS to get any use from this site - especially the animations page, it can be kind of tricky if you don't know what you're doing. Be sure to follow whatever instructions or tutorials I have - and look at examples. I'll have more tutorials up soon.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is just a side project for me. There are no fees, no ads, and minimal tracking - I only count page views, no user-by-user tracking or cookies. It's also extremely mobile-friendly. Install it as a PWA on your phone or tablet to access easily while you're working on your computer. Finally, it's not finished - I have much more planned, and would be more than happy to hear any suggestions for tools you would find handy: <a href="mailto:hello@hotdi.sh" target="_blank">hello@hotdi.sh</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/@sleumasm" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> @sleumasm</a>

					Two years ago, in May 2018, I had the idea and made <a href="https://mitchs.co/keyframes1" target="_blank">Keyframes version 1</a>. It took about a week. It worked, but the code was messy - thrown together with jQuery and didn't work at all on mobile. After I put it up, I didn't touch the code again. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Fast forward two years. I still really like the idea, and knew it could be improved. I also have a bunch of free time. So I decided to rewrite the entire thing from scratch. I used it as an excuse to teach myself some things I didn't already know - frameworks or tools I hadn't used in any other projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now we're here. I built in on Vue, deployed it on <a href="https://vercel.com" target="_blank">Vercel</a>, and have the source up on <a href="https://github.com/mitchas" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for anyone. 
				</p>
				<p class="small mtop-sm">
					Here's a list of some of the less obvious features in no particular order.
					<ul>
						<li>Keyboard Shortcuts</li>
						<li>Dark Mode/Light Mode toggle - set at first based on your device settings.</li>
						<li>Detects an on-screen keyboard and hides certain UI elements to make room.</li>
						<li>Use your device's orientation sensors to adjust shadows.</li>
						<li>Install Keyframes as a PWA if your browser supports it - hit the menu -> Add to Homescreen.</li>
						<li>PWA feature: Works offline, checks for update each launch, and notifies you of changes.</li>
						<li>PWA feature: Native sharing through installed apps.</li>
						<li>Disable UI animations (other than the necessary ones) if you don't like motion.</li>
						<li>Chose which page/app you would like to see by default when you visit keyframes.app.</li>
						<li>Fully responsive - works on everything from phones to desktops.</li>
						<li>Swipe and touch gestures supported on mobile.</li>
						<li>Lock scrolling and blur content behind modals.</li>
						<li>Toast notifications and smaller alerts.</li>
						<li>Tooltips to help with properties and formatting - can also be disabled in the settings.</li>
						<li>See what is saved to your local storage, and delete it if desired.</li>
						<li>Click to copy to clipboard.</li>
					</ul>
